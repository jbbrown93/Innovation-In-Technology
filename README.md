Final Project for my course CSC170: Web Design and Development

##Multipage Website Milestones:

###Page Layout:
I created a Homepage (index.html) that serves as an entry point to my other four pages. All pages share common elements, except each has unique content.

###Design & Layout:
For my overall layout, I chose to use Inline-Block since it was the most effective and visually pleasing layout technique for my particular webpages.

Includes visual cues that tell the user they're looking at a group of excerpts taht refer to the webpage they have clicked. For instance, when clicking on the Carol Bartz menu, the user is sent to the relevant webpage and the menu tab turns a darkened color. 

###Banner:
Designed my banner in the HTML files' header, using images and a slogan.

###Main Menu:
A horizontal-style, navigation menu that links to each page in my website.

To be meaningful, the main menu answers the following questions for users:

(1) _Where am I now?_

(2) _Where can I go?_

I designed the menu to indicate the "current" page by hightlighting in a dark color, compared to the other menus.

###Footer:
Contains my name, copyright, and the corresponding references for each webpage.
