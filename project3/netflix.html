	<h3>What Netflix is Today</h3>
	<p>Netflix, Inc. is the world's leading DVD (Digital Video Disc) rent-by-mail company. The firm has more than 1.1 million subscribers who typically pay a monthly fee of $19.95 for unlimited rentals, provided they have no more than 3 discs out at one time. The company offers more than 15,000 titles and maintains an inventory of more than 5 million discs. To speed delivery, Netflix has opened more than 20 regional shipping centers around the United States, and most DVDs are received by customers a day or two after ordering them on the company's Web site. More than a third of the publicly traded company is owned by Jay Hoag's Technology Crossover Ventures. </p>


<h3>Beginnings of Netflix</h3>
<p>Netflix was founded in Scotts Valley, California, in August of 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, both veteran "new technology" entrepreneurs, to rent and sell DVDs over the Internet. Randolph had previously helped found a computer mail order company called MicroWarehouse and then served as vice-president of marketing for Borland International, while one-time math teacher Hastings had founded Pure Software, which he had recently sold for $700 million.Hastings, who supplied the firm's startup cash of $2.5 million, had reportedly hit upon the idea for rental-by-mail when he was forced to pay $40 in fines after returning an overdue videotape of the film Apollo 13.
The DVD format, which can store a high-quality copy of an entire feature film on a single five-inch disc, had been introduced in the spring of the year and less than a thousand titles were then available. Although the hardware needed to play DVDs was fairly expensive and owned by relatively few Americans, Hastings and Randolph thought the disc had the clear potential to replace bulkier, lower-resolution videotape as the consumer format of choice. </p>

<p>Key to the firm's initial strategy was the fact that few video stores carried DVDs, making renting them in person a hit-or-miss affair. The company was also able to take advantage of the small size and light weight of the discs, which could be shipped to users very cheaply. The firm experimented with more than 200 mailing packages before finding one that could safely ship a disc (in a plain case without cover art and inserts) for the cost of a single first-class stamp. A stamped return mailer was also enclosed. NetFlix.com (with a capital "F," as the name was originally rendered) promised to virtually guarantee titles would be in stock, with reasonably quick delivery offered through the U.S. Postal Service. The company pledged to buy more than 1,000 copies of new releases which could be reserved in advance for shipment on the day they were made available in stores.</p>

<p>The company opened for business on April 14, 1998, with 30 employees and 925 titles for rent, which comprised nearly the entire catalogue of DVDs in print. The firm offered some "soft-core" Playboy titles but shied away from hardcore pornography to avoid the potential for legal problems in certain states. NetFlix initially offered a seven-day DVD rental for $4, plus $2 shipping, with the cost going down when additional discs were rented. Discs could be kept longer for an additional fee. New DVDs were also offered for sale at a discount of up to 30 percent. Consumers could decide to purchase a rented disc once they got it home by having the balance of the retail price charged to their credit card. The firm's Web site offered a number of informational features including movie reviews, and once a customer had rented several titles a profile would be generated that automatically suggested additional films of interest based on the characteristics of ones already chosen.</p>

<h3>Formulation of a Subscription Plan</h3>
<p>In late September, NetFlix introduced a new service, <b>the Marquee Program</b>, which allowed members who paid $15.95 per month to pre-select four DVDs, with no late fees or due dates. Customers could also rent new discs each time they returned one and put themselves in a queue for checked-out titles in which they were interested, much as a library had an advance reservation system for popular books. CEO Hastings commented that the new program was possible because the company had achieved the economics of scale, with 10,000 orders processed each day by its own proprietary software system. Despite its growing popularity, for fiscal 1999 the company reported losses of $29.8 million on revenues of only $5 million. Like many Internet startups, NetFlix was still spending heavily to entice customers to its Web site, betting that it would become profitable after the brand was better established.
In February 2000, NetFlix introduced a new service, CineMatch, which compared rental patterns among its customers and looked for similarities in taste, using this information to recommend titles to people whose profiles were similar. It could also be programmed to combine the attributes of two users, such as a married couple, and recommend titles that both might like. The information gleaned from the CineMatch system, which required customers to rate 20 films using a five-star scale, was also shared with movie studios to help them plan marketing campaigns. Early the next year, the company changed the Marquee Program to offer unlimited rentals for $19.95 a month, with a maximum of four titles out at a given time, though this was later dropped to three. Shipping and handling were included in the price. At the same time, the firm phased out single-title rentals, as 97 percent of its business was now derived from the Marquee Program. The company was currently distributing more than 100,000 DVDs per week.</p>

<h2>One Million Subscribers Mark</h2>

<p>Netflix hit the <em>one million subscriber mark in February of 2003</em>, by which time it had also opened five additional shipping centers. Its stock price was on the rebound and in the spring hit $22 a share, almost 50 percent more than it had commanded at the IPO. June saw the firm report its first profitable quarter to date, and it also became one of the first Silicon Valley companies to count stock options as expenses, a move that came in the wake of the public outcry over a number of corporate accounting scandals. The company gave stock options to all of its salaried employees, and this was expected to add $2 million in costs in the latter half of the fiscal year. Also in June, Netflix was awarded U.S. patents for its software systems that tracked DVD rentals and compiled customer requests. By mid-summer, the company had more than 1.1 million subscribers and a library of 15,000 titles to choose from.
After more than five years in business, Netflix, Inc. was still in growth mode, only just having turned the corner to profitability and still fending off challenges from several heavyweight competitors. It had the advantage of an early start, a strong distribution system, customer loyalty, and the newly received patents for its software programs. The company was also starting to look like one of the rare e-commerce firms that would establish itself as a permanent part of the business world. </p>

<h3>Netflix Globally</h3>

<p>Netflix launched its instant streaming service in Canada in the fall of 2010, making Canada the first international market expansion for Netflix. On September 22, 2010, Netflix became available in Canada for $7.99/month, but with a severely limited selection.  In 2011, Netflix began to expand its services into 43 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean by the end of that year, offering content in English, Spanish and Portuguese. On September 5, Brazil became the first country in Latin America to introduce the service, followed by Argentina on September 7, Chile on September 8, Colombia on September 9 and Mexico on September 12, with the service having become available in the rest of the continent over the next few weeks. Netflix launched in the UK and Ireland on January 9, 2012, and in The Netherlands on September 11, 2013. </p>
