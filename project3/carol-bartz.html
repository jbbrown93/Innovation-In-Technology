				<p><strong>CEO of Autodesk</strong></p>

					<p>She became CEO of Autodesk in 1992. According to Forbes, Bartz "transformed Autodesk from an aimless maker of PC software into a leader of computer-aided design software, targeting architects and builders." She is credited with instituting and promoting Autodesk's "3F" or "fail fast-forward" concept – the idea of moulding a company to risk failure in some missions, but to be resilient and move on quickly when failure occurs. She stepped down as CEO in 2006 and became the executive chairman of the board.

					Autodesk net revenue substantially increased during her 14-year tenure as the company's CEO, annual revenue rose from $300 million to $1.5 billion, with the stock price rising an average of 20 percent annually.

					Bartz served on several boards of directors, including those of Intel, Cisco Systems, Autodesk, BEA Systems, Network Appliance, and the Foundation for the National Medals of Science. Additionally, she has been a member of the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.</p>

				

				<p><strong>CEO of Yahoo!</strong></p>

				

					<p>On January 13, 2009, Bartz was named CEO of Yahoo!, the Internet services company which operate the fourth most-visited Web domain name in the world, succeeding co-founder Jerry Yang. During a conference call with financial analysts later in January 2009, she announced her intention to make sure Yahoo! got "some friggin' breathing room" so the company could "kick some butt." Rob Hof of Business Week was skeptical that Bartz or anyone else could save the company: "... it's not yet clear if Bartz can turn Yahoo around no matter how good she may be."

					In May 2009, Reuters reported that she had already "worked through an impressive checklist" at her new company, "upending the organizational structure, replacing executives and cutting costs, including 675 jobs, or 5 percent of the workforce." Analysts described her efforts as precisely what the company required, but, as reporter Alexei Oreskovic observed:

					For Yahoo's ranks, still shell-shocked from deep cuts in 2008 — including 1,600 axed jobs — the hope that Bartz brings is increasingly mixed with a dose of fear and uncertainty. Yet broad support remains for Bartz despite the tough talk, canceled holiday parties and forced vacations that have come to define her era.</p>

					<p>With a new round of job layoffs and the removal of a number of Yahoo! sites, "anxiety within the ranks has been exacerbated by what some say is a growing sense of secrecy", for which Bartz has a notable reputation: "The informal flow of information once common within the company has come to a halt." Bartz was also quoted to have said that she would "drop-kick to fucking Mars" employees who leak to the press. Oreskovic quoted a fearful anonymous insider: "We are all sort of wanting to believe in her because we really want to see Yahoo! turned around, but it still doesn't make it any less scary when you don't hear about what's coming up. Everything is on a need-to-know basis."

					At her one year mark at Yahoo in January 2010, Bartz gave herself a "B-" grade for the job done in 2009: "It was a little tougher internally than I think I had anticipated. I did move fast, but this is a big job." Others in the media, however, rated her job higher given the challenges she had to manage.</p>

			

					<p>When Bartz was hired by Yahoo in early 2009, she was paid an annual base salary of $1 million. She was eligible for an annual 400% bonus and received 5,000,000 shares in addition to an equity grant of $18 million of stock (to compensate for the forfeiture of the value of equity grants and post-employment medical coverage from her previous employer). In 2010 Bartz was named “most overpaid” CEO by proxy voting firm Glass-Lewis when she received $47.2 million in compensation.</p>

			

					<p>On September 6, 2011, Bartz was removed from her position at Yahoo! (via phone call by Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock), and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company. Bartz expressed her desire to remain on the Board of Directors. However, on September 9, 2011, Bartz resigned from the company's Board of Directors.</p>



			

				<p><strong>Corporate board memberships</strong></p>

				<p>Ms. Bartz has been a member of eight public company boards in the last 20 years. She is still on the board of Cisco (Since 1996).</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2011/09/06/report-yahoo-cans-ceo-carol-bartz-heres-what-went-wrong/"><strong><em>Why Yahoo! Fired Bartz</em></strong></a></h3>

		

		<p>Just two and a half years after taking over at troubled Internet icon Yahoo, CEO Carol Bartz is out. Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse, brought in early on in Bartz’s tenure, has been named interim CEO while Yahoo does a “comprehensive strategic review,” according to Yahoo’s announcement.</p>



		<p>The news was first reported by AllThingsD’s Kara Swisher. TechCrunch also reported that Bartz messaged Yahoo employees that she was “fired over the phone by Yahoo’s Chairman of the Board,” clearly a parting shot at Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock, who expressed support for Bartz at Yahoo’s annual meeting just a few months ago.</p>



		<p>The tough-talking, sometimes profane Bartz, a respected veteran of Autodesk and Sun Microsystems, had hoped to bring her management skills to bear on a company that was adrift for years and unable to capitalize on what is still one of the Web’s largest audiences under one corporate roof. And she did clean house, hacking into Yahoo’s infamous matrix management system that had slowed down the introduction of innovative products and jettisoning many operations. That helped Yahoo double its operating margins.</p>



		<p>But nothing seemed to work well enough to recharge Yahoo’s growth, and the steady flow of talent out Yahoo’s yellow-and-purple campus not only underscored Bartz’s lack of success at the turnaround, but made a turnaround all the more unlikely as time went on. Even as the online advertising rebounded quickly following the economy’s 2008 meltdown–buoying Google, Facebook, and a gazillion Web startups–Yahoo’s results remained subpar at best. Its shares, which closed at a little under $13 today, are at about the same level as when Bartz joined in January 2009.</p>



		<p>It’s possible that Yahoo couldn’t be turned around, at least not this soon. After all, former CEO Tim Koogle, former Hollywood executive Terry Semel, and even Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang couldn’t do it before her, not even with stockholder activist Carl Icahn’s gun pointed at his head. But clearly Yahoo’s board–in particular Yang and Bostock, according to Swisher’s report–had lost patience in the face of a constant drumbeat of dissatisfaction from investors.</p>



	

		<h3>Awards</h3>

		

		<p>Bartz received the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur Of The Year© Award in 2001, which spans more than 140 cities and 50 countries worldwide. In 2005 she was included in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.</p>

		<h3>Personal Life</h3>

		<p>Bartz is a survivor of breast cancer. She is married to Bill Marr, a former executive at Data General and Sun Microsystems. They have three children: Bill, Meredith, and Layne. Her hobbies include golf, tennis, and gardening.

		On balancing a career with family, Bartz says: "I have a belief that life isn't about balance, because balance is perfection ... Rather, it's about catching the ball before it hits the floor."</p>





	

		<p><a href="http://www.more.com/reinvention-money/careers/world-according-carol-bartz?page=4"><strong><em>Bartz's Bout with Cancer</em></strong></a></p>



		<p>Bartz took a similar approach 14 years ago to her bout with cancer. Recruited at 43 for the biggest job of her life and anticipating a busy few months, she scheduled a week’s vacation between jobs and packed it with a teeth cleaning, a Pap smear and, last, a mammogram.</p>



		<p>During the screening, she was impatient with the technician, who kept pulling her back for one more picture. Bartz was eager to go pick Layne up at a birthday party. "I kept telling the technician to hurry it up," she recalls. The next morning, she told her husband, "You know, it was a little odd yesterday. This technician just kept rechecking me." Ten minutes later the doctor called: She had breast cancer.</p>



		<p>Bartz began her new job a few days later, but waited a month before she announced at a trade show press conference that she had breast cancer, would undergo surgery and be out for a month. "Which breast?" hollered one reporter. "What an asshole," Bartz says, remembering the moment.</p>



		<p>Recovering from a mastectomy and trans flap surgery, to rebuild the breast with abdominal tissue, was brutal. She took just four weeks off, then worked full-time through seven months of chemotherapy treatments. "It’s a blur now," she says, "but the chemo part was hell. The biggest hell was that I gained so much weight." She put on and later took off 70 pounds. Bartz still worries about her weight, snacking constantly on diet cheese and diet soda.</p>



		Bartz coped with cancer by refusing to feel sorry for herself. "I was of the mind, and frankly still am, that if you focus too much on yourself, you get kind of possessed."



		<p>Still, looking back, Bartz says she overdid the "tough guy" routine. "Please tell people that when doctors say it takes six weeks to recover, you shouldn’t go back to work after four," she says. "Missing work those two weeks wouldn’t have killed anybody. And it was really tough on me. I should have stayed home." She also remembers how she wanted to shield her family from her own worries, but didn’t join a support group. "I wish I had dropped the attitude that ‘I’m too busy’ for a group. That was wrong."</p>



		<p>Bartz may have some regrets, but she "doesn’t believe in running around with should-haves and would-haves and could-haves," she says. She has always gotten done what had to be done.</p>



		<p>There’s an irony in her recent decision to give up the power of the CEO job to Carl Bass. Back in 1993, Bartz bought Bass’s company, then fired him when she felt he was pushing too hard for change at Autodesk. A few months later, she realized she needed him and hired him back. He went on to develop some critical software and helped the company reverse a dangerous slide during the dotcom years.</p>



		<p>Bartz has assured Bass, she says, that she will allow him to have control and run the company. "I promised myself that, before I make any new commitments, I’ll see what it’s like not to work 80-hour weeks." This is terra incognita, she emphasizes. "When I say it’s an unknown, it’s an unknown."</p>



		<p>No one — not her family, friends, or Bartz herself — can picture her spending the next 10 years fine-tuning her golf swing or even puttering around the garden. "I have this work ethic, and that just doesn’t go away," she says. "But I also always feel a little insecure. I’ve been there, I’ve seen how tough life can be and how fleeting this can be. I will never lose that."</p>
